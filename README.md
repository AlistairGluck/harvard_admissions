# harvard_course_offerings
The Rmd file in this repository, when knitted, produces a horizontal bar graph that displays data on Change in number of courses offered by different departments between Spring 2019 and Fall 2018.  I played around with the color to attempt to show a nice range.
In the final knitted product, one can see a drastic decrease in Freshmen Seminars being offered, likely due to a decrease in enrollment of freshmen.  Economics had a boosted set of offerings, due to Raj Chetty's class and others, perhaps?
